# Appointment Scheduler

This Appointment Scheduler lets users select a day and a one-hour time slot between 9AM and 5PM to meet with us. It integrates with Twilio to send a confirmation text that their appointment has been scheduled.
This also comes with a [Cosmic Extension](https://www.cosmicjs.com/extensions) so we can manage the appointments right from within the Cosmic dashboard.
